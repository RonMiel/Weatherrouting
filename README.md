# Weatherrouting
Offshore Weatherrouting via InReach (Satellite Communicator) based on FastSeas.com

The inReach Satellite Communicator allows communication via SMS (160 char) to and from email-accounts and mobile phones using the Iridium Satellite Network. This is a stable and cheap communication channel when sailing offshore.

FastSeas provides weatherrouting based on your boats performance data and weather gribs. Routing requests can be requested online via web interface or via email to FastSeas.com

This solution allows to request and receive a route via inReach for the next 24 hrs.
The information received is shortened to the waypoints and the wind, winddirection and gusts at that point and time.

It is assumed that a sailor under way requests a routing every day and therefore is able to plan the nex 24 hours run with the
most accurate weather information available.

Please find more information on further documents provided here.

This is a informaiton tool only and noone is reliable for any problems, issues or accicents related to the use of this solution. It is the sole responibility of the skipper to choose a route appropiate for the weather conditions and capabilities of yacht and crew.

Enjoy sailing
