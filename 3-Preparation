In order to use the solution there are some prerequesits and steps to do:

1. You need to have an gmail email-account.

2. Get a twilio-account in order to be able to send SMS messages based on appplication scripts.
I have no relationship with twilio,just selected this service as it looks capable
of doing things I needed for an acceptable price. 

3. Send a testmessage from your inReach to the twilio-phone-number as the inReach-service
only allows replys from phone-numbers previously messaged from inReach. This only needs to be done once, as the status
of the phone-number is remembered. This is also a way to find yout the phone-number of your inReach device,
if you have not used it before.

4. In the scripts published here no need to fill in:
  a- your twilio credentials (accountSid amd athorityToken)
  b- the mobile number attached to your twilio account
  c- the phone-number of your inReach device
  
5. In addition to implementing the google scripts in your google drive account you need
to upgrade your twilio test-account to productuin acount. Test-accounts are not able to message
unverified target numbers, and you technically cannot verfify your inReach number. Therefore I highly recommend to set
"mobile=true" in the twilio-send script to be able to test the system in sending the reply to your
mobile phone (not the twilio mobile).
