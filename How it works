After the solution is setup and tested you will be able to:

1. Send a route request to your gmail account as needed, intended is every 24 hrs.

2. A Google-script checking periodically for this incoming mail on your account is completing the request with the
position included in the message and forwwarding the correct request via mail to fastseas.com

3. Another Google-script checking perdiodically for the reply from fastseas.com is picking up the returned route,
extracting the data from the attached gpx-file and sending selected information as SMS to your inReach Device.
If the route needs more that 160 char, the information is sent in more than one message.

4. A second SMS provides general information about the whole rest of the route to the target destination.
Just to have a general view of expected conditions and travel time.
